## Lec 2.1 Data to Scores Intro - 3  2025

### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- AI models could be trained to be a estimater on some problems
### ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
- Like some applications on mobile are now able to estimate how serious, how much money that you should pay for a short of picture (data) that you feed them.
### ðŸ§  Insights & Reflections
- however, those models are now still kinda unpopular since AI need structed data, but in bussines industry, we usually get unstructed data (email,...) 
### ðŸ¤” Questions I Had
 - The key things that this models aren't popular is AI can not actually collect informations from all the source (email, facebook,...) since it lacked of an AGI to actually understand the informations, so what if we created an AI system that keep tracking on the espacial words like "unhappy
 " angry",... to classify and summit to the chatbot to predict the outcome ??
