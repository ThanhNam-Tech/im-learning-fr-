## Lec 2.1 Data to Scores Intro - 3 July 2025

### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- AI models could be trained to be a estimater on some problems
### ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
- Like some applications on mobile are now able to estimate how serious, how much money that you should pay for a short of picture (data) that you feed them.
### ðŸ§  Insights & Reflections
- however, those models are now still kinda unpopular since AI need structed data, but in bussines industry, we usually get unstructed data (email,...) 
### ðŸ¤” Questions I Had
 - The key things that this models aren't popular is AI can not actually collect informations from all the source (email, facebook,...) since it lacked of an AGI to actually understand the informations, so what if we created an AI system that keep tracking on the espacial words like "unhappy
 " angry",... to classify and summit to the chatbot to predict the outcome ??

## Lec 2.2 Data to Scores: 7 steps overview - 3 July 2025
### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
End to End build process for ML models<br>
<br>
Step 1: Define Target Intelligent Action <br>
Step 2: Collect Data<br>
Step 3: Label Data<br>
Step 4: Extract Features <br>
Step 5: Design ML Algorithm Architecture <br>
Step 6: Train Models<br>
Step 7: Test Models/Predict <br>
### ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
as it just an introduction of 7 first step to build a ML models
### ðŸ§  Insights & Reflections
this lecture still hevily describe that data is the key thing of build an AI
### ðŸ¤” Questions I Had
none.

## Lec 2.3 ML Model Process pt1 - 4 July 2025
 ### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
term : sentiment  detection engine -> is the machine that predicts humans' feeling through label and even unlabel data.
step 2 Collect Data : there are two kind of dala clolecting medthods - from recent customer - from historical storage.
step 3 label data : is the most impacful step for supervised learning - clasify which data could be used
### ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
like in the insurance car industry, we need to feed the AI a lot of car images, which car will depict the more terrible status
### ðŸ§  Insights & Reflections
data for training AI systems is the main reason why user's data are now being sell on a high rate.
### ðŸ¤” Questions I Had
Why do companies buy user data to train AI, instead of just using something else â€” like classified or synthetic data?

## Lec 2.4 ML Model Process pt2 - 5 July 2025
 ### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways

## Lec 2.4 ML Model Process pt3 - 5 July 2025
 ### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
we can build a models using linear regression model by classify information by a line with a function f(x) : ax+b

in the third demension, we also have another one which classify information by a surface function f(x) : Ax + By + Cz+ D
### ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
as in the real worlds, to maximine the accuracy of the function, we could upgrade it in to ax^2 or even ax^3

### ðŸ§  Insights & Reflections
He only gave a general explanation of how the function works in two dimensions. However, in some specific cases, I think we classify information based on whether the function's output (the y-value) is positive or negative, which essentially indicates which side of the boundary the point lies on.

### ðŸ¤” Questions I Had

so in those modern function, do they claaify information by the value of y ?

## Lec 2.5 ML Model Process pt4 - 5 July 2025
### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
training the AI models usually means estimating the parameters 
### ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
still the examples of estimating the feeling of one who report something.
### ðŸ§  Insights & Reflections
As a vietNamese student, I had learnt about these mathetic problems deeply, so These informations just remind me, nothing too new
### ðŸ¤” Questions I Had
none.

## Lec 2.6 ML Model Process pt4
 -> videos is short ( 3 mins) and include the relevant use of how a AI model can.

 ## Lec 2.7 ML Model Process pt5
-> a conclusion about those previous steps that he has demonstrated. 

## 2.8 Data to Classes pt1
-> Data to classes means how data should be classified by AI
### ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
-> how the email that tagged with spam/ relevant in your DM box.

## 2.9 Data to Classes pt2
So in the very early state, when you want to build a model, like reading articles then point out the main idea is about A or B, you should made a function which decided by a group of human, who try to classify and process the information.

## 2.10 Data to Classes pt3
using conditional Probability function to setup a better classfy system

## 2.11 Data to Clusters pt1
suggesting a method of choosing a key word related to the main topic to eliminate the labeling steps since it expensive and wasting time for bussiness 

## 2.12 Data to Clusters pt2
using clustering and K means methods to skip the supervised learning step which are methods that include auto correct by being fed data, and classifying data
## 2.13 Overview of Deep Learning
overview of how AI transforms business decision-making and operations, designed for non-technical learners or early college students.
# All The Questions I Had In Lec 2
### 2.1
 -  The key things that this models aren't popular is AI can not actually collect informations from all the source (email, facebook,...) since it lacked of an AGI to actually understand the informations, so what if we created an AI system that keep tracking on the espacial words like "unhappy
 " angry",... to classify and summit to the chatbot to predict the outcome ??
#### solution : 
-> there were actually many experient over this topic to develop a machine called mini step toward AGI by google, apple,...
### 2.2
 - N/A
#### solution : 
 -> N/A
### 2.3
 - Why do companies buy user data to train AI, instead of just using something else â€” like classified or synthetic data?
#### solution : 
 -> buying real world data is cheaper since it is not labeled, and how ever, labeled data may only work on limited models of AI
### 2.4
 - so in those modern function, do they claaify information by the value of y ?
#### solution : yes, all function even sigma, lim function are also know as f(x) = y, so basically yes.
### 2.5
- N/A
#### solution : 
-> N/A
