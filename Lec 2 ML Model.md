## Lec 2.1 Data to Scores Intro - 3 July 2025

### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- AI models could be trained to be a estimater on some problems
### ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
- Like some applications on mobile are now able to estimate how serious, how much money that you should pay for a short of picture (data) that you feed them.
### ðŸ§  Insights & Reflections
- however, those models are now still kinda unpopular since AI need structed data, but in bussines industry, we usually get unstructed data (email,...) 
### ðŸ¤” Questions I Had
 - The key things that this models aren't popular is AI can not actually collect informations from all the source (email, facebook,...) since it lacked of an AGI to actually understand the informations, so what if we created an AI system that keep tracking on the espacial words like "unhappy
 " angry",... to classify and summit to the chatbot to predict the outcome ??

## Lec 2.2 Data to Scores: 7 steps overview - 3 July 2025
### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
End to End build process for ML models<br>
<br>
Step 1: Define Target Intelligent Action <br>
Step 2: Collect Data<br>
Step 3: Label Data<br>
Step 4: Extract Features <br>
Step 5: Design ML Algorithm Architecture <br>
Step 6: Train Models<br>
Step 7: Test Models/Predict <br>
### ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
as it just an introduction of 7 first step to build a ML models
### ðŸ§  Insights & Reflections
this lecture still hevily describe that data is the key thing of build an AI
### ðŸ¤” Questions I Had
none.

## Lec 2.3 ML Model Process pt1 - 4 July 2025
 ### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
term : sentiment  detection engine -> is the machine that predicts humans' feeling through label and even unlabel data.
step 2 Collect Data : there are two kind of dala clolecting medthods - from recent customer - from historical storage.
step 3 label data : is the most impacful step for supervised learning - clasify which data could be used
### ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
like in the insurance car industry, we need to feed the AI a lot of car images, which car will depict the more terrible status
### ðŸ§  Insights & Reflections
data for training AI systems is the main reason why user's data are now being sell on a high rate.
### ðŸ¤” Questions I Had
Why do companies buy user data to train AI, instead of just using something else â€” like classified or synthetic data?

# All The Questions I Had In Lec 2
### 2.1
 -  The key things that this models aren't popular is AI can not actually collect informations from all the source (email, facebook,...) since it lacked of an AGI to actually understand the informations, so what if we created an AI system that keep tracking on the espacial words like "unhappy
 " angry",... to classify and summit to the chatbot to predict the outcome ??
#### solution : 
-> there were actually many experient over this topic to develop a machine called mini step toward AGI by google, apple,...
### 2.2
 - N/A
#### solution : 
 -> N/A
### 2.3
 - Why do companies buy user data to train AI, instead of just using something else â€” like classified or synthetic data?
#### solution : 
 -> buying real world data is cheaper since it is not labeled, and how ever, labeled data may only work on limited models of AI
