## 3.1 Evaluating ML Systems
When evaluating a Machine Learning model, don’t rely solely on accuracy, especially with skewed datasets. Use the Confusion Matrix values TP, TN, FP, FN — obtained by comparing the model’s predictions with the ground truth on a held-out test set — and apply Precision, Recall, and F1-score formulas for a more reliable performance assessment.
  Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
  Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
  Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
  F1-score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

## 3.2 Python Introduction
 an introduction to Python : an easy-to-learn programming language widely used in Machine Learning due to its clear syntax, extensive libraries, and versatility

## 3.3 Python Datastructures
Lists in Python store ordered data and are accessed by their index, making them ideal for sequences or rankings. Dictionaries store data as key–value pairs, allowing fast lookups based on unique keys. Choosing between them depends on whether you need to access data by position or by a specific identifier.
