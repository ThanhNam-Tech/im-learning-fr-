This repo contains personal notes and summaries from my study journey in the Columbia Universityâ€™s AI for Business course (as an NRA student)



Lec 1.1_Intro to AI - 30 June 2025

##ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
 An introduction into many news terms : Deep learning - AGI - Machine learning,...
 AI : the machine that can make decide on perception data which based on probability -> business can take advantages on so many aspects. 
## ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
 Uber - self driving, Google - self driving.
 Collecting date related to marketing or customer service complaints.
 Chatbox AI - talk to customer service departments.
## ðŸ§  Insights & Reflections 
 AI is an extremely powerful tools for human especially on business field.
 By that reasons as a leader, they have a reasons to filter the human resources - enhance the AI system to seek for a cheaper - more efficient worker.
## ðŸ¤” Questions I Had
 He still not shown me about what deep learning and AGI actually is.
 I tried to make some researchs and found an interesting difference betwwen "Automation" and "augementation"



Lec 1.2_Intro to AI pt2 - 1 July 2025

##ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways

AI -> MACHINE LEARNING -> DEEP LEARNING

 Machine learning : as usal we need to code all the possible situations that may occur 
=> with AI we can solve those problems with AI estimations and let them decide the outcome.

 Deep learning : a part which stay deeper than machine learning that provides a huge sets of advantages without requiring a feature engineering -> reasons why this methods become popular nowadays.

 He told that machine learning is the foundation of AI ( in the recently )
## ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
 We could train an AI chatbot by feeding them parallel corpora instead of coding and predicting all the input informations.
## ðŸ§  Insights & Reflections 
 AI has been created and developed for decades, since now machine learning is such a powerfull system to train AI -> leading to the reason why Machine learning is the key foundations off recent AI 
## ðŸ¤” Questions I Had
 He showed a lot of machine learning methods such as : 90 base conditions, random fields, random forest support vector machines,...
 He told that AGI - can do almost human's tasks, have not created yet. However, we are now can autovoice chat with GPT,GEMINI,PI for hours, that is not called Artificial General Intelligence ? (AGI)  (turning test ?)
