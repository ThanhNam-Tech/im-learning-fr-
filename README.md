## Lec 1.1_Intro to AI - 30 June 2025

### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
An introduction into many new terms: Deep learning â€“ AGI â€“ Machine learning,...  
AI: the machine that can make decisions on perception data which is based on probability â†’ businesses can take advantage in so many aspects

### ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
Uber â€“ self-driving, Google â€“ self-driving
Collecting data related to marketing or customer service complaints
Chatbot AI â€“ talk to customer service departments

### ðŸ§  Insights & Reflections
AI is an extremely powerful tool for humans, especially in the business field
For that reason, as a leader, they have reasons to filter the human resources â€“ enhance the AI system to seek a cheaper, more efficient worker

### ðŸ¤” Questions I Had
He still has not shown me what deep learning and AGI actually are
I tried to make some research and found an interesting difference between "Automation" and "Augmentation"

## Lec 1.2_Intro to AI pt2 - 1 July 2025

### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
AI â†’ MACHINE LEARNING â†’ DEEP LEARNING  

Machine learning: as usual, we need to code all the possible situations that may occur  
â†’ with AI, we can solve those problems with estimations and let it decide the outcome

Deep learning: a part which stays deeper than machine learning that provides a huge set of advantages without requiring feature engineering â†’ reasons why this method becomes popular nowadays

He said that machine learning is the foundation of AI (recently).

### ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
We could train an AI chatbot by feeding it parallel corpora instead of coding and predicting all the input information

### ðŸ§  Insights & Reflections
AI has been created and developed for decades
Since now, machine learning is such a powerful system to train AI â†’ leading to the reason why machine learning is the key foundation of recent AI

### ðŸ¤” Questions I Had
He showed a lot of machine learning methods such as: 90 base conditions, random fields, random forest, support vector machines,...  
He said that AGI â€“ which can do almost all human tasks â€“ has not been created yet. However, we can now autovoice chat with GPT, GEMINI, PI for hours. Isnâ€™t that called Artificial General Intelligence? (AGI) (Turing test?)

## Lec 1.3 Short History of AI - late night 30 June 2025

### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
AI was created around the 1950s by a group of scientists  
The more AI is developed, the cheaper the cost it takes â†’ exhibiting outperformance compared to human resources

### ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
Perceptron: divide information into 2 layers â†’ estimate the weight sum â†’ simulate how the neuron works â†’ then lay the foundation of Neural Network

### ðŸ§  Insights & Reflections
Since things are cheaper â†’ more data could be stored â†’ AI became such a powerful weapon

### ðŸ¤” Questions I Had
There was AI winter I â†’ II and something called "New Hopes" in 2010. What is that?

## "AI hasn't failed â€” our expectations did. It was overhyped before it was ready." â†’ Why did we stop funding AI?

## Lec 1.4 What is real and What is overhyped? - 2 June 2025

### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
Some AI chatbot agencies are not fully developed

### ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
Like AI driving cars, they actually exist but in a limited domain

### ðŸ§  Insights & Reflections
Whenever building or trying to find a solution using AI, remember to choose carefully

### ðŸ¤” Questions I Had
None.

## Lec 1.5 W1.5 AI Solution Factors - 2 June 2025

### ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
DATA                â†’ PROBLEM  
ALGORITHM     â†’     FUNCTION (as an automation plan, AI heavily depends on your input and output)  
SPEED               â†’ INDUSTRY  

DATA might be the most important thing for AI learning systems â†’ when building an AI system, just be really careful about what kind of data, and how much data you have

### ðŸ“Š Real-World Examples
Explainability problems â†’ which occur in, for example, the banking industry â†’ AI decisions are hard to explain

### ðŸ§  Insights & Reflections
Kind of data, output, and industry actually heavily affect how AI works
Like AI driving cars must have the response time as fast as possible and so forth

### ðŸ¤” Questions I Had
Okay, things sound cool, but can we actually create an AI system that works in all industries, like it has the ability to respond in 0.1 sec?  However, based on the emergence of the situation, it could somehow adjust the time to respond.  I mean, adjust all the systems required for the solving
