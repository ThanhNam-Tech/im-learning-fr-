## 4.1 AI Solutions
The ADR framework helps build effective AI solutions by evaluating Algorithm Viability, Impact, Data, and Recurrence to ensure the problem is solvable, valuable for business, supported by quality data, and occurs frequently enough to justify automation. Applying ADR ensures solutions maximize efficiency, learning, and business impact.
## 4.2 Building AI Systems for Customer Service pt1
Defining the business value, determining data requirements, choosing methods and tools, integrating into current workflows, and encouraging organizational adoption are the five essential steps in developing an AI customer service system.

## 4.3 Building AI Systems for Customer Service pt2
The main value of an AI customer service system is to reduce unnecessary interactions by enabling self-service and decrease handle time with automated verification and real-time answer suggestions, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction.
AI customer service systems rely on collecting and integrating data from multiple channels, such as web, email, chat, social media, and phone, to understand customer behavior and preferences. Using this data, AI can reduce handle time, predict customer needs, and automate responses, creating value for both the organization and its customers.
