## 4.1 AI Solutions
The ADR framework helps build effective AI solutions by evaluating Algorithm Viability, Impact, Data, and Recurrence to ensure the problem is solvable, valuable for business, supported by quality data, and occurs frequently enough to justify automation. Applying ADR ensures solutions maximize efficiency, learning, and business impact.
## 4.2 Building AI Systems for Customer Service pt1
Defining the business value, determining data requirements, choosing methods and tools, integrating into current workflows, and encouraging organizational adoption are the five essential steps in developing an AI customer service system. If these procedures are followed successfully, the AI solution will be useful, effective, and accepted by both staff and clients.
## 4.3 Building AI Systems for Customer Service pt2
The main value of an AI customer service system is to reduce unnecessary interactions by enabling self-service and decrease handle time with automated verification and real-time answer suggestions, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction.
AI customer service systems rely on collecting and integrating data from multiple channels, such as web, email, chat, social media, and phone, to understand customer behavior and preferences. Using this data, AI can reduce handle time, predict customer needs, and automate responses, creating value for both the organization and its customers.
## 4.4 Building AI Systems for Customer Service pt3
In customer service, data is generated at every stage of the customer journey, from awareness to advocacy, across multiple channels like email, calls, web, and social media. Integrating and managing this diverse, continuous stream of data is challenging, especially in large organizations where conflicts or errors (e.g., ghost calls) may occur. Planning data collection early and choosing the right methods ensures AI systems can create real value through automation, prediction, and improved customer experience.
## 4.5 Building AI Systems for Customer Service pt4
When working with customer data, it is crucial to distinguish between structured and unstructured data and understand their quality and noise levels. Based on this, suitable algorithms such as scoring, classification, or clustering can be applied to segment customers and predict behaviors effectively. The ultimate goal is to choose the most fitting techniques that deliver valuable business outcomes while minimizing complexity in the existing system.
## 4.6 AI Team Sequence pt1
1. Building an AI system requires not just algorithms and data, but the right team structure and workflow.
2. The process involves sequencing: assembling the right roles (AI lead, data scientists, engineers, security), discovering user pain points, collecting and labeling data, and iteratively developing prototypes.
3. As the product scales, additional engineers and processes ensure stability, security, and alignment with user needs for long-term success.
4. ## 4.7
The lecture explains how to design chatbots or question-answering systems: first define the system type, then choose between agent-driven, human-driven, or hybrid approaches, design the user workflow, and ensure proper data sources. Human-like responses improve customer satisfaction and sales, while hybrid models provide both safety and flexibility. Ultimately, success is measured through clear KPIs such as task completion, satisfaction, and conversion rates.
